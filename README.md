SOC 470 Project; Pedigree

Hi, this is my final project for my senior seminar SOC 470! The task for the final is to create a product that, in some way, reflects or contests the course theme of “diversity in American families.” In this case we (i) created a website that serves the purpose of an informative blog or micro web article focused on matters of multigenerational households in America. 

This web app was created from scratch with original ideations. This repository consists of working and completed files/versions of the final project! You will find a wireframe + stylesheet and HTML/CSS/JavaScript files if applicable.

The goal is to create a product: that is in-part informative, relevant, and creative.
