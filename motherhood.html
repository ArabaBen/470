					   <h6> <b>NEW CHALLENGES</b> </h6>
					  <p> New challenges facing new parents include the balance between family and careers, education, overcoming a culture of blame and types of parental styles. 

					  </p>
					  <p>
						  There's been a rise in the need and conversation of soft or gentle parenting(millennial parenting). This style of parent is one that doesnt center punishment or abuse when navigating ways to instill accountability and responsibility into children.  It teaches values of empathy, respect and accountability for both parent and child involved. But like anything, there are critics and critiques of parents and how they chose to discipline or raise their children. This is blame culture. It is a culture in which adults are blamed for mistakes, shortcomings, or failure to meet the status quo often by their children’s behavior, appearance or development- academic, socially, or otherwise. This subject is especially evident in spaces where conversations of respecting genders/ gendering of children come up. But also in everyday life.

					  </p>
					  <p>
						  When it comes to childrearing and careers, there’s always been the expectation of mothers to subside their careers for their families. But rarely in our society do we hold the same expectation of fathers involved. This in hand contributes to guilt parents feel and goes hand in hand with blame culture. When mothers leave the workforce not only does the economy suffer but mothers lose their sense of financial independence and a loss in income in households. But the opposite is true when mothers remain in the workforce and allocate child care to family or nannies (etc.) that they become labeled as bad mothers or absent/abandoning mothers. Something has to give. Because when we examine multigenerational households, not only are there multiple streams of income within households, but new mothers and fathers have the grace to reminane in the workforce whilst having chances to be present in the lives of their children. And even if they aren’t, family becomes the emotional safety net<a href=””>….</a>

					 <h6><b>TAKING ON PATERNITY LEAVE</b></h6>
				  	<P>
						Paternity leave is paid family leave for fathers. This topic and conversations surrounding the subject came to rise as late as 1993 when women and men in the United States took unpaid leave to be actively involved in the overall care of their newborn. But unequally in the U.S it has become culturally more acceptable for new mothers to take maternity leave than it has been for fathers and men to do so. This social and economic inequality has been rooted in sexist ideals of who performs childcare labors and how they do so or are involved. But times are not the same. Men and women alike want more social and economic change in their professional and domestic lives. Not only did the state's lack of recognition of the importance of men and fathers roles in the early infancy of newborns dictate the beliefs many carry in our society about fatherhood and involvement, but that also impacted the financial sacrifices and invisible labors placed on new mothers to be. 
					</P>
					
					<p>
						A big part of multigenerational households working effectively is the time investments of adults in a family unit. Time investments means having adults present and available to give time and attention to each child within the household. In nuclear families where childcare and labor are traditionally the responsibility of women and mothers in the household, this means that in a given home of say 3 kids, there's only one adult (the mother) to soothe, appease, entertain, engage, and care for 3 at a time. That’s hard to do. And even if it is done, each child wouldn’t receive the same level of time and care. Paternity leave is crucial in an age where many are pushing to remain close to family for health, financial, and emotional reasons. The fight continues to give both parents equal amounts of time and pay to remain involved in the care of their newborn and children.

				  <h6><b>ASKING FOR HELP</b></h6>
					  <p>Asking for help is hard. Many resources have made it easy to do so. Whether anonymously or otherwise. There are ton of outreaches,<a href=”https://www.nysparentguide.org/”> guides</a>, <a href=”https://raisingnewyork.org/blog/”> parental blogs</a>,  <a href=”https:www.momsofourfuture.com”>support groups </a> and so much more. </p>
					  <p>
						  Parenthood is hard especially for 1st timers. When it comes to parenting there’s no escaping the culture of blame. This along with many factors makes it much harder for new parents to especially ask for help and have their needs met. 

					  </p>
					  <p>Here's our suggestion:</p>
						  <ol type="1">
								<li>Let go of the guilt. You are not any less of a parent or bad for not knowing nor needing help. You will not be a burden. Nor be abandoning a newborn when seeking your needs.</li>
								<li>Know what you need and ask for it clearly. People cannot know what they do not know. Help others help you. </li>
								<li>Say yes or no to things that do or do not align with your goals for parenting, nursing, and childcare. Make it simple and affirm it. 
							  </li>
							  	<li>Trust yourself and extend grace to yourself. You are doing the best you can, and sometimes that is more than enough. Use daily affirmation</li>
						  </ol>
