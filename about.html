			<p>This is pedigree. </p>
			<p>Pedigree is the given name of an academic project by <a href="https://bntuma.w3spaces.com/aboutt.html">Araba Ocran</a> focused on trends in family and society in america.  This site was created to showcase findings of an <a href="Mid-Term%20Research%20Project%20-%20Google%20Docs.pdf" target="_blank">academic research</a> project on multigenerational households and child successes within families. </p>
			<p>The mission is simple, helping individuals and families navigate and achieve the good life they want. Contents on this site are true in nature, researched, verified and are meant to serve as a valuable source for readers.</p>
			
			<p>
				Studies suggest that children raised in multigenerational households within a typical Eastern and ethnic society had far more favorable upbringings than that of children raised in a typical Western/American societies. Families and their structures are as complex as we are human.

				
				In investigating how multigenerational households and its relationships impact the overall development of a child/ children, we accessed that more than just a research paper, it'd be far more beneficial and accessible to users to compile our findings into an informational blog site.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				
				We'd simply hate to uphold centuries of knowledge gatekeeping within academia and academic spaces through the use of jargons(special words, hard for others to understand). Information should be free for all to not only access but to understand and draw from. That's why we made Pedigree. Our information is free, viable, and readable. Thank you for stopping by.
