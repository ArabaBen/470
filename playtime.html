				The older we get, the more we forget to play. We forget that play allows us to not only connect with those around us but also with ourselves. Studies have found that when it comes to play, “Play improves the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional well-being of children and young people. Through play, children learn about the world and themselves. They also learn skills they need for study, work and relationships such as: confidence”(NIB.gov). For adults play “Play for adults is critical in our stressful go-go-go lives. Play has been shown to release endorphins, improve brain functionality, and stimulate creativity. And it can even help to keep us young and feeling energetic. Studies show that play improves memory and stimulates the growth of the cerebral cortex”(Yenigun, Sami).

				We want to encourage you to not only begin to view play as an important aspect of your life but also to also imbed it in the lives of your children and family. It’s a fun way to stay engaged, connected, and help everyone grow.

							Tenzi Buildzi Game is a multi player game based on the original game of tetris. It is a fun competitive game for 3 to 4 players at a time. It's a great selection for STEM activities for elementary aged kids and games for middle schoolers because it can help develop and reinforce many different skills that include fine motor skills used for stacking, spatial reasoning skills used to create a stable tower, creative divergent thinking by creating your own tower using the block cards, and building cooperative skills by working together to build a tower through cooperative play.
